Architecture vision

I was the Billing Architect for Program Telco at Telco, one of the few transformation programs in IBM that successfully replaced aging core legacy systems and went
live in a reasonable period of time. This was achieved without major customer impacts in three geographies. IBM revenue was $n million.
Billing was one of three major solution components. It delivered complex Telco offerings to position Telco favourably in a competitive market. As this was a package enabled
business transformation, the role required strong leadership working with the client business community. Integration of over 40 existing systems with a billing package not
previously implemented to run Telco system load required strong technical leadership. Through the architecture, design, build and test of the technical architecture I led a
technical team of 30+ people onsite. The solution is still in production today. Refer to Experience Profile: Billing in Program Telco.



DEMONSTRATE BUSINESS IMPACT

Program Telco successfully replaced separate legacy billing systems for Telco Region across three countries by a single solution. The key business benefit for Telco
was the ability to go to market with complex offerings that included bundling and discounting in highly competitive mobile markets. The business impact for IBM
included revenues of $n million. The design was proposed for use in Telco Qatar. Refer to Experience Profile: Billing in Program Telco for more details.


My contributions to this program were:
Leadership of development of the core billing technical solution through to customer acceptance of architecture deliverables
Persistence in pursuing a predictive performance model of billing run times that allowed timely corrective changes to the vendor

LBG (Lloyds Banking Group)has embarked upon implementing a holistic solution to create a Transaction Management Hub (TMH) covering e-payments (domestic and international), cards, and clearing transactions in various lines of businesses. The Transaction Management Hub has committed to routing all payment schemes by the end of 2014. In order to deliver this full capability the implementation has been broken down into several transition states in order to incrementally build up the capability of processing all schemes. The Accounting Hub will be the single point to process all posting transactions to the product platforms. It will align to the TMH route-to-live strategy and deliver capability to post for the payment schemes.
The accounting hub will abstract the product platforms from the payment engines. Today the payment engine has the necessary logic to perform account postings directly with the product platforms. This results in multiple point-to-point interfaces between the payment engines and the product platforms. This has resulted in tight coupling between the payment engines and the product platforms. If an account migrates from one product platform to another the payment engines have to refresh their reference data. This strong dependency also limits changes towards the integration points between the payment engines and the product platforms. Additionally the payment engines has to maintain scheme specific integration points with the product platforms this increases the count of number of interfaces a payment engine has to maintain. All of these issues make the current landscape complex, and costly to maintain or change.

Complexity 

In order to resolve this business problem,the solution had to be developed using an Accounting hub will be the single channel through which the account positing will be forwarded to the product platforms. Hence the payment engine will send product platform agnostic posting request to accounting hub. Accounting hub will identify the correct product platform and invoke the appropriate interface on the product platform. Accounting hub will also maintain all necessary reference data required for account posting to the product platform. This solves the problem of data duplication, impact due to account migrations, and interface changes on the product platforms.

General Criteria Checklist
	
	

Criteria Met During this Project?
	
	
	
	
	
	

Understand Business Aspects: understand the stakeholders' business needs and how they relate to their business and mission. IBM Certified professionals must have business insight into how all activities and work products serve the business needs of a variety of stakeholders and how they relate to the larger business context.

L1: Experienced

 
	

	

	
 
	

Elicit and manage stakeholder requirements: given approved business goals, objectives, and constraints, document, clarify, refine, detail, and prioritize functional and non-functional requirements. IBM Certified Architects need to be able to take business goals, objectives, and constraints, and to define the functional and non- functional requirements that can meet them. They also need to be able to identify stakeholders and ensure that the requirements they have identified meet their needs.

L1: Experienced


Establish vision: Given requirements and a list of stakeholders, identify approaches, tools, techniques, and technologies to meet the requirements, and explain the present and future rationale so that stakeholders accept the choices and agree with the rationale. IBM Certified Architects must be able to establish a vision that meets business requirements and is agreed to by stakeholders. 

Architectural complexity: Experience producing architectures that:

    Involve the application and integration of a number of dimensions (products, technologies, services, processes, management, security, governance, etc.) from either the business, enterprise, or solution perspective.

    Encompass functional components together with non-functional or operational components.

IBM Certified Architects have a variety of experiences that demonstrate their ability to successfully deliver solutions to complex problems.  For Business Architects, this could involve business’ strategic intent (e.g., business vision, mission, business logic, ambition) with some operational aspects (e.g., people, process, technology, management).

For IT and Enterprise Architects, this could involve the application and integration of different products, technologies, and services, or domains.

    L1: Architectural complexity is demonstrated across more than one (1) dimension or domain. 


Client Relationship Management:  The Architect must have a high level of communications, consulting, and client relationship skills. The Architect must be able to clearly communicate complex technical and business concepts, both to clients (internal or external) and to team members, and to negotiate change. Problem-solving of client business and technical issues is a principle role of the IT Architect, and he or she must be capable of effectively identifying and framing problems, leading the collection of elements of information, and integrating this information to produce timely and thoughtful decisions.

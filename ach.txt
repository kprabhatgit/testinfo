The Accounting Hub will be the single point to process all posting transactions to the product platforms. It will align to the TMH route-to-live strategy and deliver capability to post for the payment schemes.

The accounting hub will abstract the product platforms from the payment engines. Today the payment engine has the necessary logic to perform account postings directly with the product platforms. This results in multiple point-to-point interfaces between the payment engines and the product platforms. This has resulted in tight coupling between the payment engines and the product platforms. If an account migrates from one product platform to another the payment engines have to refresh their reference data. This strong dependency also limits changes towards the integration points between the payment engines and the product platforms. Additionally the payment engines has to maintain scheme specific integration points with the product platforms this increases the count of number of interfaces a payment engine has to maintain. All of these issues make the current landscape complex, and costly to maintain or change.
Accounting hub will be the single channel through which the account positing will be forwarded to the product platforms. Hence the payment engine will send product platform agnostic posting request to accounting hub. Accounting hub will identify the correct product platform and invoke the appropriate interface on the product platform. Accounting hub will also maintain all necessary reference data required for account posting to the product platform. This solves the problem of data duplication, impact due to account migrations, and interface changes on the product platforms

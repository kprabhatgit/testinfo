Hi Sandip,

Thanks for your confirmation.

I would like to update you the reporting  structure has been changed for BEM designer(for all) . Now we(BEM Designer) are directly reporting to Phil for PCB, Ed for Barclay card and Rabik nathan for ROw .i.e you can say  these are line managers for BEM Designers. They are  directly assigning task/project to us(BEM Designer) and also they are tracking us on weekly basis.

Phil,ED and Rabik are directly reporting to Akhil.

These individuals are  from barclays  and are replacement of Satyaki basu.


so  this is for your information we should keep Phil and Akhil in loop to update about leave plan for BEM Designer while you are directly communicating to them other i will communicate them accordingly 

Kind Regards
Kumar Prabhat
